# Final feedback

## Overall score: 9/10

Confession: I wasn't able to run the program, so I'm looking forward to seeing
the demo!

It looks like the final version ended up pretty far from the original plan. The
database looks like it's not fleshed out, and the UI looks fairly simple. But
it looks like you continued to put a lot of good effort into handling
ingredients well. :-)

## Specific callouts

* Colin, it looks like you had a lot of fun with the parsers. :-)
* Camila, thanks for the retrospective in the README. It's great to hear the
  narrative of how the work unfolded.
* Sofi, Sindhura, and Nikil, it looks like most of your work was on the UI?
  That's not a huge amount of credit to go around for three people. But I'm
  glad you were each able to contribute something!
