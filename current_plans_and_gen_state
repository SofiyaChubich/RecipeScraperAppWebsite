Data:
    Ingredients have all been processed and cleaned
    Units of measurement have been set and standardized
    
    TODO: 
        create standard values for measurment of jars/cans/bags/etc
        finish umbrella terms

Sorting:
    Database is mostly set up and only need to add rows for ingredients/measurements and the rest of the data

    TODO:
        figure out how sorting will work with the umbrella terms
        make it so that more people are able to edit the databse than just Sofiya

        create a backup sorting system in the event that the database doesn't work
            dictionary of all ingredients with the value being all of the recipies with that ingredient -> get couple ingredient/sets and get intersection to find recipies 
            drawback: ingredients have to be added manually -> just give recipes w/o worring about measurements

UI:
    homepage is done and working
    plans are set for what the filter search and recipe search pages look like
        
    TODO:
        Add extra visual elements (quantity) to filter search page and finish recipe search page
