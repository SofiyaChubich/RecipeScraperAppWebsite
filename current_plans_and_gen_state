Data:
    Ingredients have all been processed and cleaned
    Units of measurement have been set and standardized
    
    TODO: 
        create function to save user data (ingredients) to file
        simplify backend functions:
            add option for quantityless (infinite) ingredient (such as salt)
            make search function based off on ingredients
            make sure given ingredients are ingredients found in recipes/real
        connect font + backend functions
    Cut:
        umbrealla terms

Sorting:
    Database is mostly set up and only need to add rows for ingredients/measurements and the rest of the data

    TODO:
        figure out how sorting will work with the umbrella terms
        make it so that more people are able to edit the databse than just Sofiya

        create a backup sorting system in the event that the database doesn't work
            dictionary of all ingredients with the value being all of the recipies with that ingredient -> get couple ingredient/sets and get intersection to find recipies 
            drawback: ingredients have to be added manually -> just give recipes w/o worring about measurements

UI:
    homepage is done and working
    plans are set for what the filter search and recipe search pages look like
        
    TODO:
        Finish ingredient addition page:
            add units - Sindhura needs to finish PR with quantities
            use backend (in progress) function to see if given ingredient is real, if it's not, inform the user and remove the ingredient
            make adding quantity/unit optional
        Finish recipe search page:
            let user choose if they want to search inclusive or exclusive of quantity
            create bubble checkbox for all ingredients added on ingredient addition page so 
                user can ask for recipe that only has ingredients that they want to use at 
                the moment
        create reuslts page (probably scrolling) to show recipes found after filtering through all recipes
            also create error page if no results are found (too specific filers/ingredients/spelling error)
    create page to display specific recipe (title, difficulty, ingredients, steps, time)


What are people doing rn:

Camila: connecting front and backend, leaving markers for places waiting on UI develeopment to connect
Colin: documentation
Sofiya: results + recipe page
Sindhura: graphic design bits + crash error bugfix
Nikhil: finishing up recipe search page and ingredient entering page
